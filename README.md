# DNS-ANALYSER-WITH-ANOMALY-DETECTION-AND-GEOIP-MAPPING

## Overview
This project is a "DNS Analyzer" that processes **PCAP files** to detect anomalies in DNS traffic and map the geographical locations of source IPs. It provides insights into suspicious DNS activity and visualizes it using a world map.

## Features
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual DNS queries, excessive NXDOMAIN responses, high traffic sources, and long subdomains.
- **GeoIP Mapping**: Determines the geographical locations of DNS queries.
- **TXT Record Inspection**: Detects suspicious TXT records in DNS responses.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates a detailed report summarizing anomalies and statistics.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.11.2
- Required libraries (install using the command below):
  ```bash
      pip install scapy geoip2 matplotlib folium
  ```
  - Scapy â†’ For packet capture and analysis 
  ```bash
    pip install scapy
  ```
  - GeoIP2 â†’ For GeoIP lookup of source IP addresses
  ```bash
  pip install scapy geoip2 matplotlib folium
  ```
  - Matplotlib â†’ For plotting and data visualization
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```
  - folium â†’ For generating an interactive GeoIP map
  ```bash
    pip install folium
  ```
  - argparse â†’ For handling command-line arguments (built into Python, no need to install separately)
  ```bash
    pip install argparse
  ```
  - sys â†’ Provides system-specific parameters and functions (built into Python, no need to install separately)
  ```bash
    pip install sys
  ```
  - random â†’ Generates random values for assigning private IP locations (built into Python, no need to install separately)
  ```bash
    pip install random
  ```
  

### GeoIP Database
Download and place the **GeoLite2-City.mmdb** database in the project directory. You can get it from [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip2-databases).
- I have uploaded the **GeoLite2-City.mmdb** file in the repository as well.

## Usage
Run the script with the following command:
```bash
python dns_analyzer.py -f <path_to_pcap> -o <output_report.txt>
```
Example:
```bash
python dns_analyzer.py -f your_own.pcapng -o dns_report.txt  
```

## Output
- **Text Report**: Summary of detected anomalies and statistics.
- **GeoIP Map**: HTML file visualizing the geographical locations of DNS queries.
